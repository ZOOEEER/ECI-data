# ECI-data
Datasets suitable for ECI tasks come from the literature performing high-throughput experiments or large-scale characterization.



## Usage

Show all the datasets' information.

```python

```

Show the statistics for one dataset.

```python

```

Show the metadata for one dataset.

```python

```

All datasets are provided as `csv` files, so they can be easily used for your own projects.

## Data Format

Four files are provided for each dataset.

| file          | description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| enzymes.csv   | Name, Sequence and other properties                          |
| chemicals.csv |                                                              |
| activity.csv  | raw values from literature                                   |
| metadata.json | the original data collection strategy, modeling strategy, and enzyme catalysis issues to be explored |

## Metadata description

This repo not only focuses on the data itself, but also focuses on the original data collection strategy, modeling strategy, and enzyme catalysis issues to be explored. The definition of metadata.json is listed in the table below. It is mainly divided into four categories: basic information, experiments, data, and models. One could call the function to show the help.

```python
